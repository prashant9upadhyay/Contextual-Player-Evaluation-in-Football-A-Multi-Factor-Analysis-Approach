Contextual Player Evaluation in Football: A Data Science Approach to Sports Analytics âš½ðŸ“Š

This repository contains the code, data, and analysis from my MSc dissertation project, "Contextual Player Evaluation in Football," which investigates the application of machine learning techniques to assess player performance and predict match outcomes in professional football (soccer).

Project Overview
The objective of this study was to explore the realm of football analytics through advanced data science methodologies. This project specifically examines the influence of match eventsâ€”particularly substitutionsâ€”on player performance and overall match outcomes. By utilizing models such as Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, the analysis aims to identify critical factors that affect player performance and inform tactical decisions.

Key Features

Player Performance Analysis: The study evaluates a range of player metrics to extract insights on how various events impact individual performances.
Substitution Strategy Optimization: The timing and context of substitutions (home vs. away) are analyzed to assess their effects on match dynamics.
Predictive Modeling: Machine learning models are employed to forecast player ratings and match outcomes, providing data-driven insights for tactical decision-making.
Data Visualization: Interactive dashboards have been developed to simplify complex data interpretation for stakeholders, including coaches and analysts.
Technical Aspects

Data Preparation: This involves merging, cleaning, and preprocessing match event data from diverse sources to ensure data integrity and reliability.
Machine Learning Models: The project utilizes algorithms such as Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, optimized for enhanced prediction accuracy.
Feature Importance: A thorough analysis is conducted to determine which features (game events, player statistics, etc.) are most influential in the models' predictions.
Performance Metrics: Key metrics, including player fitness, fatigue management, and the impact of tactical events, are analyzed to provide comprehensive insights.
Tools & Platforms
The analysis is implemented using Python, SAS Viya, and various libraries such as scikit-learn for machine learning applications.

Challenges and Limitations
The project encountered challenges, including data limitations (missing values, incomplete datasets) and the complexities of accounting for contextual factors such as weather conditions and player morale. Future research could benefit from the integration of real-time data and the application of advanced techniques like deep learning and reinforcement learning.

Future Work

Real-Time Analytics: Integrating live data streams to enhance in-game decision-making processes.
Advanced Machine Learning: Exploring artificial intelligence and deep learning techniques to further improve prediction accuracy.
Interdisciplinary Collaboration: Collaborating with experts in football tactics, physiology, and sports psychology to achieve a more holistic analysis.
